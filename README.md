## Note from Momo:

This Is planned to be Used to give more Poses avaiable by default. We Don't have a Great Solution for a Great Animator base so I'm Modifying one that Will better Use what we have. Will do something similar to another Project going about, but much more Simplified as I am a bit Smooth Brain.

## Notice:
This will not be receiving any updates until ChilloutVR's IKSystem is fixed. 

I do not want to release a locomotion prefab that has to mitigate animation bleeding into FBT IK.

# CCK.BaseAnimatorPatch

# features
* Less use of anystate.
* Better jump/fall animations.
* Emotes don't get stuck first time for desktop keybind press.
* FBT disable locomotion toggle, forces TPose if enabled.
* Split logic for Desktop, VR, and FBT.
* Emotes can be changed mid-emote, allowing dance spam.
* Support for AvatarMotionTweaker using Upright parameter.
* Improved crawl animation from mixamo.
* Improved crouch idle to prevent feet clipping.
* Parameter to easily change Motion speed.
* Desktop smooth stand, crouch, and prone transitions.

# note
this animator makes heavy use of transition interupts and transition order, so messing with any built-in transitions may break functionality or make the animator feel more clunky

This is pretty much a from-scratch animator based on what I use personally for my models for CVR and VRC. Feel free to use this as a base for your avatars.
